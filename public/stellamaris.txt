ST AGNES
St. Agnes was a Roman girl who was only thirteen years old when she suffered martyrdom for her Faith. Agnes had made a promise to God never to stain her purity. Her love for the Lord was very great and she hated sin even more than death! Since she was very beautiful, many young men wished to marry Agnes, but she would always say, "Jesus Christ is my only Spouse."  Procop, the Governor's son, became very angry when she refused him.  Procop accused her of being a Christian and brought her to his father, the Governor. The Governor promised Agnes wonderful gifts if she would only deny God, but Agnes refused. He tried to change her mind by putting her in chains, but her lovely face shone with joy. Next he sent her to a place of sin, but an Angel protected her. At last, she was condemned to death. Even the pagans cried to see such a young and beautiful girl going to death. Yet, Agnes was as happy as a bride on her wedding day. She did not pay attention to those who begged her to save herself. "I would offend my Spouse," she said, "if I were to try to please you. He chose me first and He shall have me!" Then she prayed and bowed her head for the death-stroke of the sword. St Agnes is celebrated in the church every 21st of January.


 
ST CATHERINE OF SIENA: DOCTOR OF THE CHURCH
Born in 1347.  The 25th child of a wool dyer in northern Italy, St. Catherine started having mystical experiences when she was only 6, seeing guardian angels as clearly as the people they protected. She became a Dominican tertiary when she was 16, and continued to have visions of Christ, Mary, and the saints.  St. Catherine was one of the most brilliant theological minds of her day, although she never had any formal education. She persuaded the Pope to go back to Rome from Avignon, in 1377, and when she died, she was endeavoring to heal the Great Western Schism. St, Catherine's letters are considered among the most brilliant writings in the history of the Catholic Church. She died when she was only 33 in 1380 and her body was found incorrupt in 1430. Feast day of St. Catherine is April 29.



ST MARIA GORRETTI
Born in Corinaldo, Ancona, Italy, on October 16, 1890; her farm worker father moved his family to Ferrier di Conca, near Anzio. Her father died of malaria and her mother had to struggle to feed her children.   In 1902 an eighteen-year-old neighbour, Alexander, grabbed her from her steps and tried to rape her. When Maria said that she would rather die than submit, Alexander began stabbing her with a knife.  As she lay in the hospital, she forgave Alexander before she died. Her death didn't end her forgiveness, however.  Alexander was captured and sentenced to thirty years. He was unrepentant until he had a dream that he was in a garden. Maria was there and gave him flowers. When he woke, he was a changed man, repenting of his crime and living a reformed life. When he was released after 27 years, he went directly to Maria's mother to beg her forgiveness, which she gave.  When Maria was declared a saint in 1950, Alexander was there in the St. Peter's crowd to celebrate her canonization. She was canonized by Pope Pius XII in 1950 for her purity as model for youth. She is called a martyr because she fought against Alexander's attempts at sexual assault. However, the most important aspect of her story is her forgiveness of her attacker -- her concern for her enemy extending even beyond death. Her feast day is July 6.  St. Maria Goretti is the patroness of youth and for the victims of rape. 
 
ST THERESE OF LISIEUX
Born in France in 1873. Tragedy and loss came quickly to Therese when her mother died of breast cancer when she was four and a half years old. Her sixteen-year-old sister Pauline became her second mother which made the second loss even worse when Pauline entered the Carmelite convent five years later.  A few months later, Therese became so ill with a fever that people thought she was dying but she was miraculously cured.  Without realizing it, by the time she was eleven years old she had developed the habit of mental prayer. She would find a place between her bed and the wall and in that solitude think about God, life, eternity. Generations of Catholics have admired this young saint, called her the "Little Flower".  They have found in her short life more inspiration for their lives than in volumes by theologians.  She often said to herself “The only way I can prove my love is by scattering flowers and these flowers are every little sacrifice, every glance and word, and the doing of the least actions for love." She took every chance to sacrifice, no matter how small it would seem. Yet Therese died when she was 24, after having lived as cloistered Carmelite for less than ten years. She never went on missions, never founded a religious order, and never performed great works. The only book of hers, published after her death, was a brief edited version of her journal called "Story of a Soul."  But within 28 years of her death, the public demand was so great that she was canonized. Therese of Lisieux is one of the patron saints of the missions, not because she ever went anywhere, but because of her special love of the missions, and the prayers and letters she gave in support of missionaries. This is reminder to all of us who feel we can do nothing, that it is the little things that keep God's kingdom growing.   Her Feast day is 1st of October but in Nigeria this has been shifted to the 2nd of October every year.

ABOUT US
“If we teach today’s students as we taught yesterday’s, we rob them of tomorrow.”
(John Dewey, Democracy and Education, New York: Macmillian, 1944, p.167)
The aim of educating a child is to prepare her to be relevant in ‘her’ future. The future of today’s child is the mid 21st century. For the child to fully take charge then, she should be taught in innovative and creative ways and not how her teacher was taught. Students should be taught bearing in mind where the world is moving economically, socially and technologically. This is the only way they can successfully gain employment after graduating from school.
Stella Maris Girls College (SMGC) is a new secondary school (full boarding) for girls, owned by the Catholic Diocese of Uromi and managed by the Sisters of St Louis. The school is situated in a peaceful and serene neighborhood of Esan land in Edo State. With its enthusiastic and highly motivated staff, the school provides a well-balanced, and sound education for girls. 
The Catholic Diocese of Uromi is committed to “further the Church’s mission of evangelization, taking into cognizance the importance of ‘catching them young’ and training children in the way they should go for their benefit, those of their parents and of the society at large”. (Culled from The Educational Policy and Operational Handbook for the Catholic Diocese of Uromi). The establishment of SMGC was motivated by the long tradition of the diocese, of empowering children with quality education for productivity, sustainability, competitiveness, and self-actualization.
AIMS OF CATHOLIC EDUCATION.
•	All people of whatever race, condition or age, in virtue of their dignity as human persons, have an unalienable right to education.
•	This education should be suitable to the particular destiny of the individuals, adapted to their ability, sex, and national cultural traditions.
•	At the same time, this education should pave the way to brotherly (sisterly) association with other peoples, so that genuine peace and unity on earth may be promoted.
•	True education aims to give people a formation, which is directed towards their final end – and simultaneously towards the good of those societies to which they belong and in which, as adults, they will have their share of duties to perform.
•	As a consequence, with the help of advances in psychology and in the art and science of teaching, children and young people should be helped to develop harmoniously their physical, moral and intellectual endowments.
•	Surmounting hardships with a gallant and steady heart, they should be helped to acquire gradually, and through constant effort, a more mature sense of responsibility towards the proper development of their own lives, and towards pursuing authentic freedom.  {Excerpts from ‘The Declaration on Christian Education: Vatican 11}  
THE SISTERS OF ST LOUIS AND EDUCATION OF THE YOUNG
The Sisters of St Louis have a long-standing history of educating. We have been involved in education for the past 180 years in some parts of Europe, America and West Africa.   All Sisters of St. Louis wherever we are involved in education are imbued with the vision of our founder, Abbé Louis Bautain, of a world healed, unified and transformed by the saving wisdom of Christianity.  As St Louis educators we are called to teach all that is true and all that is good, all that needs to render human beings more enlightened and better. In the words of Abbé Louis Bautain, the Sisters of St. Louis are charged to “Give an education that is at once solid and wide in scope, enabling the students to see as one whole all that concerns human kind, all the wonders of the natural world...... educated in this way, the students will be led to an understanding of the heart of things”.
Abbé Louis Bautain, the founder of the Sisters of St. Louis was born and went to school in Paris, France, in a very troubled time.  The trauma of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars surrounded his early years.  Louis was a very bright and hardworking student and at twenty years of age he became a professor of philosophy at the Royal College of the University of Strasbourg.  He loved his work, he yearned to share his search for the meaning of life; “Why am I here, Where did I come from, What is my destiny?”  Reason which seemed to him to be the truest guide did not satisfactorily answer these questions.  He found that students were searching for something more concrete than the romantic idealism and egoistical materialism that was the philosophy of that time.  With youthful enthusiasm he set out to discover TRUTH, i.e. the meaning of existence.  He had the reputation of being the best lecturer in the university.  He worked and studied with passionate intensity in continuing his search for truth.  A university colleague said, “Nothing was inaccessible or difficult to the mind of Bautain, his intelligence climbed all heights, shone in all spheres and was everywhere at home”.  He had a triple university doctorate, in medicine, literature and theology, and he was also an expert, because of his writings, in philosophy and law.  Yet, he was a very simple and warm hearted man.  
Like our founder, the Sisters of St Louis’ view of teaching is that it should present challenges to the young and allow them to challenge the situation of the world, so that they may be interested in creating a better world.  For us freedom is freedom to choose, freedom for responsibility.  Speaking and living are the two greatest ways of communication of the Truth that we live by.  We need to think well in order to speak well, and everyone should give time and effort to speaking well and being able to discuss and debate.  ‘We will have made progress if we succeed in giving our pupils a taste for serious study and if we encourage them to have wide interests which will enable them to see things as a whole, the interests of humankind, all parts of the world and the wonderful world of Nature.  This will widen their horizons, raise them above themselves and interest them in all that is human, because they themselves are human’ (Louis Bautain, Prizegiving Day, Institute de la Toussaint, Headmaster’s Report, 1837).

REFLECTIONS OF PAST STUDENTS OF ST. LOUIS SCHOOLS ON THE EXPERIENCES OF THEIR SCHOOL DAYS.
•	We were brought up to love one another.  In general, the St. Louis ‘charisma’ was an ‘agape’, a living experience of love in togetherness, unity and sharing.
•	In St. Louis we were not only taught classroom subjects.  We were also educated on how to become respectable young ladies with good manners.  They taught me so much manners and virtues – apart from academics! Both the Rev. Sisters and the staff were determined to produce well-groomed ladies.
•	I cherish the etiquette.  Socially we had a thorough education on etiquette.  We were taught how to carry ourselves with good deportment – how to walk smartly; how to sit modestly and with poise; how to react and behave appropriately in public; how to conduct ourselves generally with decorum everywhere – like educated ladies.
•	We were taught how to talk and communicate politely, how to read/speak clearly with emphasis on good enunciation, pronunciations, punctuation and phrasing.  All St. Louis girls of our time were ‘well spoken’.
•	We were taught to be lady-like and how to interact with people from different tribes, religious and economic backgrounds.  We were taught how to live peacefully.        {culled from The Grace and Task of the Catholic Educator}.

Welcome!
“Do not train children to learn by force and harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.” – Plato. 
	Education is power and can only be achieved by a willful desire to discover, recover and rediscover. This is a continuous cycle which is linked to the fact that learning stops when one dies. In order to keep learning, one must always have an inquisitive mind, a mind that always wants to find out about what is happening, how things happen and what makes things happen especially in the global village of the 21st century.
	The mind at birth is a tabular rasa and can only admit what comes to it. Therefore, education, especially of children, must be tailored in a way to get them curious about their environment and to help them see the need to contribute to its development. The millennium schools must strive to achieve this by guiding the students towards self-discovery first, and then help them to attain their full potential in every sphere of life, teaching them that there is no limitation to what they can achieve as long as their minds can conceive it. These and many other values are what we promise to offer Stella Maris girls. 
	At Stella Maris Girls College, we have broken the barrier of limitations and are determined to build generations of women that will not struggle based on gender, class, race or tribe, but rather would take on the world and bring about sporadic millennium inventions in both native and artificial intelligence. Women whose work will speak for them and would not have to argue about responsibilities and roles in the society, rather they would show true responsibility through achievements in the building of a better society.
	It is clear from our vision and mission statements that as a school, we do not impose the old ways of learning on our students, we simply help them individually to make a discovery of how fun learning is through technological innovations without losing focus on all-round development of their individuality. So, because of the eclectic nature of the system, children develop mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually as we help them draw strength from their maker through prayers and personal meditations. 
	Welcome to a new world of education with ease. Welcome to an institution driven by clear purpose and passion to expand the current coverage of education for future women leaders dedicated for service to God and humanity. Welcome to Stella Maris Girls College!
