    "content": "Do not train children to learn by force and harshness; but direct them to it by what amuses their minds, so that you may be better able to discover with accuracy the peculiar bent of the genius of each.” – Plato. Education is power and can only be achieved by a willful desire to discover, recover and rediscover. This is a continuous cycle which is linked to the fact that learning stops when one dies. In order to keep learning, one must always have an inquisitive mind, a mind that always wants to find out about what is happening, how things happen and what makes things happen especially in the global village of the 21st century. The mind at birth is a tabular rasa and can only admit what comes to it. Therefore, education, especially of children, must be tailored in a way to get them curious about their environment and to help them see the need to contribute to its development. The millennium schools must strive to achieve this by guiding the students towards self-discovery first, and then help them to attain their full potential in every sphere of life, teaching them that there is no limitation to what they can achieve as long as their minds can conceive it. These and many other values are what we promise to offer Stella Maris girls. At Stella Maris Girls College, we have broken the barrier of limitations and are determined to build generations of women that will not struggle based on gender, class, race or tribe, but rather would take on the world and bring about sporadic millennium inventions in both native and artificial intelligence. Women whose work will speak for them and would not have to argue about responsibilities and roles in the society, rather they would show true responsibility through achievements in the building of a better society. It is clear from our vision and mission statements that as a school, we do not impose the old ways of learning on our students, we simply help them individually to make a discovery of how fun learning is through technological innovations without losing focus on all-round development of their individuality. So, because of the eclectic nature of the system, children develop mentally, physically, emotionally and spiritually as we help them draw strength from their maker through prayers and personal meditations. Welcome to a new world of education with ease. Welcome to an institution driven by clear purpose and passion to expand the current coverage of education for future women leaders dedicated for service to God and humanity. Welcome to Stella Maris Girls College! Rev Sr. Christie Adegoroye ssl Principal."
